Sample code for my Magma Rails 2011 presentation on learning HAML and SASS
==========================================================================

Run this application in development mode and view the source to see the ouput of the samples (looking at the rendered pages in the browser won't do much for you.)

For the SASS examples, click on the compiled .css file included in the header to see the output. The HAML output is of course in the HTML body, wrapped in comments so you can see what comes from the example code.

Check out *app/views/layouts/application.html.haml* for how to make an HTML 5 layout in HAML
